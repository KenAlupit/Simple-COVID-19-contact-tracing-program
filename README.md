# Simple-COVID-19-contact-tracing-program

A simple COVID-19 contact tracing program where store visitors can input their personal information (Name, birthdate, and phone number), and the program will generate a user ID unique to each customer and the user's entry date and time to the store. Administrators can access visitor information by first logging in with a pre-defined password then choosing which category they are searching such as date and time, first name, last name, and phone number.

Features:
- Generates unique user ID to each customer, and when the same customer return it will retain the customer's previous user ID.
- Logs visitor entry date and time.
- A page like search results wherein it only shows 10 search results at a time with a next and previous function.
- Administrators can search date and time at the same time or independently.
